# Human-Robot Interaction Intent Detection Demonstration (MIRA Robot, Raspberry Pi 5)

This repository contains supplementary videos accompanying the paper:

> **Real-Time Human-Robot Interaction Intent Detection Using RGB-based Pose and Emotion Cues with Cross-Camera Model Generalization**

All experiments were performed on the **MIRA social robot** running a **Raspberry Pi 5 (CPU-only)**.

## 🎥 Supplementary Videos

- **Video S1 — Intent Detection:** A user approaches the robot; the system detects engagement and initiates a greeting.
- **Video S2 — Non-Interaction:** The user passes by without interacting; intent probability remains low.
- **Video S3 — Engagement–Disengagement:** The user engages, then turns away; the system smoothly detects both transitions.

Each video demonstrates real-time inference of the trained Transformer + MINT-RVAE model.
